# Editor Audit — Language & Content

**Date:** 2026-01-27  
**Reviewer:** Editorial Review  
**Framework:** Applebaum/Snyder institutional voice, Anthropic clarity principles, think tank credibility standards  
**Scope:** Site-wide content evaluation with page-level observations

---

## Executive Assessment

CCG's written voice is **distinctively institutional**—operating in the register of Applebaum's historical-to-present analysis and Snyder's urgent clarity. The language avoids NGO clichés ("make a difference," "join our community") and marketing hyperbole, instead achieving what might be called **procedural gravitas**: the voice of an institution that takes itself seriously because its subject matter demands it.

**Overall Grade: A-**
- Voice & tone: A
- Clarity: A-
- Bilingual parity: B+
- Consistency: B+
- Action language: B
- Accessibility text: B-

## Part I: Voice & Tone Analysis

### The Applebaum-Snyder Register

CCG content successfully operates in the register of serious democratic discourse:

| Quality | Evidence | Assessment |
|---------|----------|------------|
| **Historical rigor** | "When public institutions are captured, justice does not vanish—it relocates." | ✓ Achieved |
| **Urgent clarity** | "Our duty to each other—and to our children—does not surrender to a captured state." | ✓ Achieved |
| **Institutional weight** | "Accountability is not vengeance; it is the restoration of consequence to action." | ✓ Achieved |
| **Philosophical depth** | "We are not a replacement for the state. We are a bridge—built for the crossing, meant to be dismantled when the destination is reached." | ✓ Achieved |
| **Avoidance of hype** | No "revolutionary," "game-changing," "transformative" language | ✓ Achieved |

### Voice Consistency Audit

| Page | Voice Register | Consistency |
|------|----------------|-------------|
| Homepage | Philosophical/urgent | ✓ Consistent |
| Charter | Constitutional/formal | ✓ Consistent |
| Transparency | Institutional/procedural | ✓ Consistent |
| Forum for Justice | Explanatory/architectural | ✓ Consistent |
| Standards | Technical/methodological | ✓ Consistent |
| Complicity Index | Data-focused/precise | ✓ Consistent |
| Error pages | Practical/human | ✓ Appropriate register shift |

**Finding:** Voice is remarkably consistent across 50+ pages. The register shifts appropriately for context (more formal in Charter, more explanatory in architecture pages) without losing institutional character.

## Part II: Clarity Analysis

### Anthropic Principles Applied

Following Anthropic's guidance on clear communication:

| Principle | CCG Application | Assessment |
|-----------|-----------------|------------|
| **Be explicit** | States what CCG is *and* what it is not | ✓ Excellent |
| **Add context** | Explains *why* each procedure exists | ✓ Excellent |
| **Avoid hallucination** | Hedges appropriately ("where evidence permits") | ✓ Excellent |
| **Structure clearly** | Uses numbered articles, sections, subsections | ✓ Excellent |

### Sentence-Level Observations

**Strengths:**
- Sentences are crafted, not corporate: "Credibility is earned through procedure, not claimed through assertion."
- Parallel structure used effectively: "We publish the rules... the safeguards... the discipline..."
- Complex ideas made accessible without dumbing down

**Opportunities:**

| Issue | Example | Recommendation |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| Some sentences exceed 50 words | Transparency intro paragraph | Consider splitting for easier parsing |
| Abstract nouns occasionally accumulate | "the obligation to truth persists" | Balance with concrete examples |
| Passive voice in procedural sections | "petitions are received" | Consider active where appropriate |

---

## Part III: Bilingual Parity

### English-Georgian Audit

| Dimension | Assessment | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| Completeness | ✓ Good | All major content translated |
| Meaning equivalence | ✓ Good | Georgian captures intent, not just words |
| Cultural adaptation | ✓ Good | Georgian formality appropriate |
| Length parity | ○ Adequate | Georgian often 15-20% longer — layout accommodates |
| Navigation labels | ✓ Good | Consistent across languages |

### Specific Findings

**Strong translations:**
- "Our duty to each other" → "ჩვენი ვალი ერთმანეთისა" (preserves weight)
- "captured state" → "მიტაცებულ სახელმწიფოს" (appropriate Georgian register)

**Opportunities:**

| Issue | Location | Recommendation |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| Some proper nouns inconsistent | "Complicity Index" vs Georgian variant | Establish canonical transliterations |
| Technical terms need glossary | Throughout | Create bilingual glossary for terms like "dossier," "triage" |
| Georgian character count in buttons | Various | Verify truncation doesn't occur |

---

## Part IV: Terminology Consistency

### Canonical Terms Audit

| Term | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Forum for Justice | ✓ Consistent | Used throughout |
| Complicity Index | ✓ Consistent | Replaces older "Integrity Index" |
| The Ledger | ✓ Consistent | — |
| The List | ✓ Consistent | — |
| Capture Engine | ○ Variable | Sometimes "The Capture Engine," sometimes just "Capture Engine" |
| IIMG | ○ Variable | Sometimes "IIM Georgia," sometimes "IIMG" |
| Right of Reply | ✓ Consistent | — |

### Naming Convention Observations

**Established patterns:**
- "The [Noun]" for integrity instruments (The List, The Ledger)
- Section names capitalized (Appeal, Record, Remedy)
- Pathways lowercase in prose ("sanctions pathway")

**Recommendation:** Create canonical terminology document establishing:
1. Official capitalization rules
2. Preferred abbreviations (IIMG vs IIM Georgia)
3. Georgian equivalents for each term

| Jump-to navigation | Long pages | ✓ Good orientation |
| Callout boxes | Transparency | ✓ Effective emphasis |

### Information Density

| Page Type | Density | Assessment |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| Homepage | Low | ✓ Appropriate for entry |
| Institutional (About, Mission) | Medium | ✓ Appropriate |
| Legal (Charter, Standards) | High | ✓ Appropriate for reference |
| Data (Ledger, Index) | Very high | ✓ Appropriate for tool |
| Process (Forum) | Medium-high | ○ Could use more visual breaks |

---

## Part VI: Action Language

### CTAs and Button Labels Audit

| Element | Current Text | Assessment | Recommendation |
|---------|--------------|------------|----------------|
| Primary petition CTA | "Submit a Petition" | ○ Adequate | Consider "Report Harm" or "File an Appeal" |

## Part VII: Heading Structure

### H1-H4 Hierarchy Audit

| Page | H1 | H2s | H3s | Assessment |
|------|-----|-----|-----|------------|
| Homepage | (Implicit in quote) | Mission, Programs | Program titles | ○ Could use explicit H1 |
| Charter | "The Charter" | Article titles | — | ✓ Good |
| Justice | "Forum for Justice" | Section names | Subsections | ✓ Good |
| Transparency | "Transparency Report" | Section headings | Subsection headings | ✓ Good |

**Finding:** Most pages follow correct hierarchy. Homepage is implicit, which may affect SEO and screen reader experience.

## Part XI: Snyder/Applebaum Stylistic Alignment

### Twenty Lessons Applied to Content

Drawing from Snyder's *On Tyranny* structure:

| Snyder Principle | CCG Content Approach | Assessment |
|------------------|---------------------|------------|
| "Do not obey in advance" | Content never assumes capture is permanent | ✓ |
| "Defend institutions" | CCG positioned as bridge, not replacement | ✓ |
| "Beware the one-party state" | Documentation focuses on systemic capture | ✓ |
| "Take responsibility for the world" | International pathways emphasized | ✓ |
| "Believe in truth" | Evidence-based, with confidence labels | ✓ |
| "Investigate" | Methodology transparent | ✓ |
| "Practice corporeal politics" | Rustaveli Project, physical presence | ✓ |
| "Make eye contact and small talk" | Georgian language, local focus | ✓ |
| "Be a patriot" | Civic inheritance, not nationalism | ✓ |
| "Be courageous" | Direct speech about capture | ✓ |

### Applebaum Historical-to-Present Pattern

CCG content often follows Applebaum's pattern:

1. **Historical precedent** ("When public institutions are captured...")
2. **Contemporary application** ("In Georgia today...")
3. **Forward-looking consequence** ("For the record, and for the future...")

This pattern appears consistently in:
- Charter preamble
- Mission statement
- Transparency introduction
- Forum architecture pages

**Finding:** The content is remarkably aligned with the Applebaum/Snyder register, suggesting intentional voice design.

## Part XII: Think Tank Credibility Markers

### Credibility Factor Audit

| Factor | CCG Implementation | Assessment |
|--------|-------------------|------------|
| **Transparency** | Funding disclosure, methodology, corrections log | ✓ Strong |
| **Independence** | "No foreign government funding" statement | ✓ Explicit |
| **Credentials** | Staff credentials page needed | ○ Gap |
| **Research quality** | Methodology page, confidence labels | ✓ Good |
| **Ideology disclosure** | Charter, Mission clearly stated | ✓ Explicit |
| **Impact documentation** | Not yet visible | ○ Gap — add impact reports when available |
| **Network/affiliations** | Partners page exists | ✓ Adequate |
| **Corrections** | Corrections log exists | ✓ Distinctive |
| **Right of Reply** | Formal process published | ✓ Distinctive |

**Finding:** CCG exceeds typical NGO credibility standards but could strengthen with staff credentials and impact documentation.

## Appendix: Voice Guidelines

### CCG Writing Principles

**Do:**
- Write as if every sentence will be quoted in court
- Explain *why*, not just *what*
- Hedge appropriately with confidence language ("where evidence permits")
- Use parallel structure for lists and series
- Prefer active voice for actions, passive for procedures
- Ground abstractions with concrete examples

**Avoid:**
- Marketing language ("revolutionary," "transformative," "game-changing")
- NGO clichés ("make a difference," "join our community," "your voice matters")
- Bureaucratic abstraction without grounding
- Emotional manipulation or urgency-signaling
- Claims without evidentiary basis
- Passive-aggressive or accusatory tone

### Sentence Templates

For institutional declarations:
> "[Topic] is not [common misconception]—it is [actual definition]. [Consequence of understanding correctly.]"

For procedural explanations:
> "We [action] because [reason]. This ensures [outcome]."

For historical-to-present:
> "When [historical pattern], [present parallel]. [Forward-looking implication.]"
