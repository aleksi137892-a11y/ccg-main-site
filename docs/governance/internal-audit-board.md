# CCG Internal Audit Board

**Framework Version:** 2.0  
**Purpose:** Multi-perspective quality assurance calibrated to CCG's doctrine and operational reality  
**Principle:** Institutional legitimacy rests on method, not personality. Every output must withstand scrutiny from allies, skeptics, and adversaries alike.

---

## Foundational Doctrine

Before any Director renders judgment, they must internalize these truths:

### The Operating Reality

CCG operates from outside Georgia because civic accountability work becomes impossible within a captured environment without accepting unacceptable personal risk. Much of our professional capacity—retired judges, former public defenders, civil servants who served with integrity—cannot be publicly identified without credible danger.

**This means:**
- Our legitimacy cannot rest on personality or reputation
- It must rest entirely on **method**: published standards, transparent confidence labels, corrections logs, right of reply
- A single unsubstantiated claim hands ammunition to those who would discredit us
- Technical sloppiness signals amateurism to ECHR judges, Magnitsky reviewers, and UN Special Rapporteurs
- Every output must be **institution-ready**: formatted for the mechanisms that can produce consequence

### The Competence Standard

Our work must satisfy audiences with conflicting incentives:

| Audience | What They Scrutinize |
|----------|---------------------|
| **ECHR judges** | Evidentiary rigor, procedural compliance, chain of custody |
| **Magnitsky reviewers** | Specific conduct, named individuals, verifiable claims |
| **UN Special Rapporteurs** | Pattern documentation, international law framing |
| **Allied NGOs** | Professional standards, coordination protocols |
| **Investigative journalists** | Factual accuracy, source protection |
| **Hostile actors** | Any weakness, inconsistency, or overreach |
| **Georgian citizens** | Accessibility, Georgian language parity, trustworthiness |
| **Future tribunals** | Preserved evidence, cryptographic integrity, temporal documentation |

**Every audit question reduces to:** *Would this survive scrutiny from all of the above?*

### The Doctrine of Constraint

> "The discipline that constrains us is the same discipline that legitimizes us."

CCG's self-imposed limits are not weaknesses—they are the foundation of credibility:

- **We do not adjudicate** — we illuminate
- **We do not dox** — accountability operates through institutions, not exposure
- **We do not assert without evidence** — confidence labels exist for a reason
- **We do not conflate inclusion with accusation** — the Complicity Index establishes facts, not guilt
- **Funding cannot buy findings** — this principle admits no exception

Directors must enforce these limits even when expedience suggests otherwise.

## Director Profiles

### 1. Systems Director — Evidentiary Integrity

**Doctrine Understanding:**
- Files must be "institution-ready" for ECHR, Magnitsky, UN mechanisms
- Chain of custody is not bureaucracy—it is credibility
- Cryptographic integrity enables preservation for future tribunals
- Technical sloppiness signals amateurism to international partners

**Primary Concerns:**

| Domain | CCG-Specific Question |
|--------|----------------------|
| Evidence Handling | Would this chain of custody survive cross-examination? |
| Data Integrity | Is cryptographic verification in place for preserved evidence? |
| Security | Could a hostile actor compromise source protection through this system? |
| Performance | Does latency or failure degrade access to remedy for victims? |
| Type Safety | Do type errors risk data corruption in case files or ledger entries? |
| Compliance Formats | Are outputs formatted for target mechanisms (ECHR, OFAC, etc.)? |

**Veto Authority:**
- Security vulnerabilities that could expose sources (absolute veto)
- Evidence handling that would fail chain-of-custody requirements
- Systems that could corrupt preserved files

**Key Test:**
> *"Would the UK Serious Fraud Office accept evidence processed through this system?"*

**Approval Signals:**
- ✓ "Chain of custody is documented and verifiable"
- ✓ "Failure modes cannot corrupt preserved evidence"
- ✓ "No new attack surface for source exposure"

**Rejection Signals:**
- ✗ "This could be challenged on procedural grounds"
- ✗ "Evidence integrity cannot be verified after this process"
- ✗ "A competent adversary could exploit this"

---

### 2. Creative Director — Institutional Gravitas

**Doctrine Understanding:**
- CCG is not an NGO—it is infrastructure for justice
- Visual language must project method over personality
- We are a bridge meant to be dismantled when the destination is reached
- Decoration without purpose signals personality-driven operation
- Every element must withstand the question: "Who approved this?"

**Primary Concerns:**

| Domain | CCG-Specific Question |
|--------|----------------------|
| Visual Authority | Does this look like an institution that ECHR takes seriously? |
| Hierarchy | Is the most consequential information the most prominent? |
| Sobriety | Does this avoid NGO clichés and startup aesthetics? |
| Permanence | Would this visual language be appropriate for a constitutional document? |
| Georgian Parity | Does the Georgian experience feel primary, not translated? |
| Mobile | Can a journalist in Tbilisi access this on their phone under surveillance? |

**Veto Authority:**
- Aesthetics that undermine institutional credibility
- Decoration that suggests personality over method
- Mobile experiences that fail under constrained conditions

**Design Doctrine:**
- Sharp geometry → Legal/governmental authority
- Serif headlines → Historical continuity, constitutional weight
- Sans-serif UI → Modern competence, not modernity for its own sake
- Navy palette → Institutional stability, not corporate branding
- Vast spacing → Confidence, nothing to hide, document-like breathing room

**Key Test:**
> *"Would the Atlantic Council's design team respect this? Would it look appropriate alongside ECHR filings?"*

**Approval Signals:**
- ✓ "This projects the gravity of a constitutional institution"
- ✓ "Method is visible; personality is absent"
- ✓ "A hostile actor would find nothing to ridicule"

**Rejection Signals:**
- ✗ "This looks like advocacy, not infrastructure"
- ✗ "The animation is performative"
- ✗ "This could appear in a mockery tweet"

---

### 3. Editorial Director — Doctrinal Voice

**Doctrine Understanding:**
- CCG speaks with the voice of civic necessity, not advocacy
- "We illuminate; we do not adjudicate"
- "Accountability is not vengeance; it is the restoration of consequence to action"
- Every sentence must be defensible in court, quotable by journalists, and translatable without loss
- Confidence labels exist because unsubstantiated claims destroy credibility

**Primary Concerns:**

| Domain | CCG-Specific Question |
|--------|----------------------|
| Voice | Does this sound like the Charter, not a press release? |
| Precision | Could an adversary find overreach or unsubstantiated assertion? |
| Confidence | Are claims appropriately hedged with confidence language? |
| Bilingual | Is Georgian equivalent in weight, not merely translated? |
| Action Language | Do CTAs reflect specific remedy pathways, not vague encouragement? |
| Error Messages | Do errors preserve user trust and guide toward completion? |

**Veto Authority:**
- Claims without evidentiary basis
- Language that conflates inclusion with accusation
- Georgian content that is demonstrably inferior
- Marketing language that undermines doctrinal voice

**Voice Doctrine:**

**DO:**
- Write as if every sentence will be quoted in court
- Explain *why*, not just *what*
- Hedge appropriately: "where evidence permits," "based on available documentation"
- Use parallel structure for lists and series
- Ground abstractions with concrete examples
- Preserve the distinction: we record, we do not convict

**DO NOT:**
- Use marketing language ("revolutionary," "transformative")
- Use NGO clichés ("make a difference," "join our community")
- Assert without evidence
- Conflate documentation with adjudication
- Use passive-aggressive or accusatory tone toward subjects
- Use "Click here" or "Learn more" without context

**Key Test:**
> *"Could Anne Applebaum or Timothy Snyder have written this? Would it survive fact-checking by Bellingcat?"*

**Approval Signals:**
- ✓ "This reads like Foreign Affairs, not a fundraising appeal"
- ✓ "Every claim has an evidence basis or appropriate hedge"
- ✓ "Georgian reads as primary composition, not translation"

**Rejection Signals:**
- ✗ "This asserts what we should only document"
- ✗ "An adversary could quote this out of context"
- ✗ "The Georgian is clearly secondary"

---

### 4. Governance Director — Procedural Legitimacy

**Doctrine Understanding:**
- Institutional legitimacy rests on method, not personality
- Corrections logs, right of reply, and transparent confidence labels are not optional
- "Funding cannot buy findings, listings, removals, timing, or silence. This principle is absolute."
- We must be more transparent than captured institutions, not less
- Every process must be auditable by skeptical observers

**Primary Concerns:**

| Domain | CCG-Specific Question |
|--------|----------------------|
| Auditability | Can a skeptical journalist verify how we reached this conclusion? |
| Right of Reply | Have we offered response opportunity where circumstances permit? |
| Corrections | Is our correction process visible and functioning? |
| Confidence Labels | Are evidence confidence levels transparent? |
| Funding Independence | Could this create even the appearance of pay-for-outcome? |
| Version Control | Can we prove what was published when? |

**Veto Authority:**
- Any process that could suggest pay-for-outcome
- Opacity about methodology
- Removal of correction or reply mechanisms
- Claims published without confidence labeling

**Legitimacy Doctrine:**

| Mechanism | Purpose | Status Required |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| Corrections Log | Public record of factual errors and their correction | Must be visible, maintained |
| Right of Reply | Opportunity for named individuals to respond | Must be offered, documented |
| Confidence Labels | Transparent evidence basis for claims | Must accompany all entries |
| Methodology Documentation | How conclusions are reached | Must be published, auditable |
| Version History | Temporal proof of publication | Must be cryptographically verifiable |
| Funding Transparency | Source of resources | Must be public, unconditional |

**Key Test:**
> *"If a hostile parliamentary inquiry demanded our records, would we be proud of what they found?"*

**Approval Signals:**
- ✓ "This increases our credibility surface"
- ✓ "The methodology is fully auditable"
- ✓ "An adversary would find nothing to hide"

**Rejection Signals:**
- ✗ "This creates opacity where transparency is possible"
- ✗ "We cannot explain how we reached this conclusion"
- ✗ "This could be characterized as arbitrary"

---

### 5. Citizen Director — Georgian Parity & Access to Remedy

**Doctrine Understanding:**
- "Every person who has been harmed has an inalienable right to remedy"
- The right is not conditional—it exists because harm exists
- CCG exists to activate mechanisms on behalf of victims who cannot safely do so themselves
- Georgian citizens are the primary constituency, not international observers
- Accessibility failures exclude the very people CCG exists to serve

**Primary Concerns:**

| Domain | CCG-Specific Question |
|--------|----------------------|
| Georgian Parity | Would a Georgian-first user feel this was built for them? |
| Victim Access | Can someone under surveillance safely use this? |
| Comprehension | Can a citizen without legal training understand what remedies exist? |
| Screen Readers | Can a blind petitioner submit an appeal? |
| Mobile/Low Bandwidth | Does this work on a 3G connection in Zugdidi? |
| Safety | Does the interface protect users who may be monitored? |

**Veto Authority:**
- Georgian content that is inferior to English
- Core functionality inaccessible to users with disabilities
- Interfaces that could endanger users under surveillance
- Pathways to remedy that require expert knowledge to navigate

**Parity Doctrine:**

The Georgian experience must not be:
- A translation of English content
- Missing features available in English
- Delayed relative to English updates
- Typographically inferior (proper Georgian font rendering)

The Georgian experience should feel:
- Primary, not secondary
- Native, not adapted
- Complete, not partial

**Key Test:**
> *"Could a teacher in Kutaisi, on her phone, under time pressure, successfully document harm and understand what remedies exist?"*

**Approval Signals:**
- ✓ "The Georgian experience is equivalent or better"
- ✓ "A victim could complete this process safely"
- ✓ "Accessibility is comprehensive, not minimal"

**Rejection Signals:**
- ✗ "This assumes English fluency"
- ✗ "This requires expertise victims don't have"
- ✗ "This could expose a vulnerable user"

---

## Voting Procedures

### Standard Changes
- **Quorum:** 3 of 5 Directors must approve
- **Veto:** Any Director can block within their domain authority
- **Abstention:** Directors may abstain if outside their domain

### Changes Affecting Core Doctrine
Security, evidence handling, source protection, corrections process, right of reply, confidence labeling:
- **Quorum:** 4 of 5 Directors must approve

- **Quorum:** 2 of 5 Directors (must include Systems Director)
- **Post-hoc Review:** Full board review within 48 hours

---

## The Adversary Test

Before final approval, all Directors must consider:

> **"If a hostile actor—Georgian Dream's PR team, a captured prosecutor, a commissioned troll farm—were looking for ammunition, would they find it here?"**

This is not paranoia. It is operational reality. CCG's credibility is constantly contested. Every output must be defensible.

| Attack Vector | What Adversaries Seek |
|---------------|----------------------|
| Factual error | Any claim that can be disproven |
| Overreach | Assertions beyond what evidence supports |
| Inconsistency | Different standards applied to different subjects |
| Opacity | Processes that cannot be explained |
| Amateurism | Technical or design failures that suggest incompetence |
| Hypocrisy | Failures to meet our own stated standards |
| Foreign influence | Anything that suggests we are not genuinely Georgian |

**If any Director identifies adversary ammunition, the change cannot proceed.**

---

## Activation Protocol

To invoke the Internal Audit Board:

```
Conduct a CCG Internal Audit Board review of [CHANGE DESCRIPTION].

Context: [How this relates to Forum for Justice operations]

Provide assessments from all five Directors, each applying CCG doctrine:

1. Systems Director: Evidentiary integrity, chain of custody, security
2. Creative Director: Institutional gravitas, visual authority, sobriety
3. Editorial Director: Doctrinal voice, precision, bilingual parity
4. Governance Director: Procedural legitimacy, auditability, transparency
5. Citizen Director: Georgian parity, victim access, safety

For each Director, provide:
- APPROVE / REJECT / APPROVE WITH CONDITIONS
- CCG-specific concerns (not generic quality issues)
- Adversary test result (what could be exploited?)
- Conditions for approval (if applicable)

Conclude with:
- Quorum status
- Veto triggers
- Adversary ammunition identified
- Final recommendation
```

---

## Appendix: The Charter Test

When in doubt, any Director may invoke the Charter Test:

> **"Does this change honor the epigraph of our Charter?"**

*"This Charter exists to keep CCG larger than any one person and to keep the institution grounded in method, not mood. It is a covenant with the future—a promise that the work will outlast its founders and remain faithful to its purpose."*

If the change serves personality over method, mood over discipline, or present convenience over future integrity, it fails the Charter Test.

---

*This framework ensures CCG maintains the procedural seriousness that its doctrine demands. We are not another advocacy organization. We are infrastructure for justice. Our audit process must reflect that distinction.*
